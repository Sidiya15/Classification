Digits classification

This project consisted of finding the best and the most suitable classification algorithm in to predict the class of any digit. Throughout the course of this project, 
we explored different types of machine learning algorithms for such task. For instance, we used several base (simple) algorithms like NaiveBayes, LogisticRegression,
K-NearestNeighbours, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, DecisionTree as well as the ensemble methods in both types :
*) averaging methods (Bagging methods which helps to reduce the variance of the base estimator and corrects the instability in the decision tree, Forests of randomized trees)
*) boosting methods where the goal is to combine several realtively weak estimators to come out with more powerful 
one and reduce the bias in the base estimators which are built sequentially (AdaBoost,
