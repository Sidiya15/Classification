# Classification
Digits classification

This project consisted of finding the best and the most suitable classification algorithm in to predict the class of any digit. Throughout the course of this project, 
we explored different types of machine learning algorithms for such task. For instance, we used several base (simple) algorithms like NaiveBayes, LogisticRegression,
K-NearestNeighbours, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, DecisionTree as well as the ensemble methods in their three forms :
    
    - Bagging methods which helps to reduce the variance of the base estimator 
    and corrects the instability during the classification process, ex: # Bagged Decision Trees, Random Forests 
    
    - Boosting methods where the goal is to combine several realtively weak estimators to come out with more powerful one 
    and reduce the bias in the base estimators which are built sequentially, ex: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine 
    
    - Stacking methods which involve a model that learns how to best combine the predictions of all the estimators whether 
    by voting, stacking or weighted average
